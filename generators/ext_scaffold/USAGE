Description:
    Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and views, along with a full test suite, just like the standard Rails scaffold generator.The ext_scaffold generator uses the Ext Javascript framework to build the GUI elements (forms and tables).

Prerequisites:
	You need to download the Ext Javascript framework from
	http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs3/download/
	and unzip it into #{RAILS_ROOT}/public/ext. Ext_scaffold was tested against version 3.2 of the ExtJS framework.

Example:
    rails generate ext_scaffold Posts [Title:String]

    This will create:
           exist  app/models
	       exist  app/controllers
	       exist  app/helpers
	      create  app/views/posts
	       exist  app/views/layouts
	      create  public/images/ext_scaffold
	      create  public/javascripts/ext_scaffold
	       exist  test/functional
	       exist  test/unit
	      create  app/views/posts/index.html.erb
	      create  public/javascripts/ext_scaffold/posts.js
	   	  create  app/views/layouts/posts.html.erb
	    generate  model
	      invoke  active_record
	      create  app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
	      create  app/helpers/posts_helper.rb
	      create  public/javascripts/ext_scaffold.js
	      create  public/javascripts/xcheckbox.js
	      create  public/images/ext_scaffold/arrowLeft.gif
	      create  public/images/ext_scaffold/arrowRight.gif
	      create  public/images/ext_scaffold/find.png
	      create  public/stylesheets/ext_scaffold.css
	      create  test/functional/posts_controller_test.rb
	      create  test/functional/posts_controller_test.rb
	       route  resources :posts
