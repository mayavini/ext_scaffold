Ext Scaffold Born Again ( By Mayavini )
======================================

Ext_scaffold plugin is based on Martin Rehfeld's original plugin modified and extended to work for Rails 3.x
  
Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and views, along with a full test suite, just like the standard Rails scaffold generator. The ext_scaffold generator uses the Ext Javascript framework to build the GUI elements (forms and tables).Pass the name of the model, either CamelCased or under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute pairs.

For in-depth step by step tutorial please visit http://mayavini.wordpress.com 

Prerequisites:
==============
	You need to download the Ext Javascript framework from
	http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs3/download/
	and unzip it into #{RAILS_ROOT}/public/ext. Ext_scaffold was tested against version 3.2 of the ExtJS framework.
	
	Also make sure that assets are not being used by your application
	- In your Gemfile comment line which says -    gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.1.5'
	- In config/application.rb set the following - config.assets.enabled = false
	- In config/initializers/wrap_parameters.rb set the following -  self.include_root_in_json = true

Installation:
============	
	rails plugin install git://github.com/mayavini/ext_scaffold.git
